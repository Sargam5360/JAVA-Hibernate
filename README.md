# JAVA-Hibernate

## What is Hibernate?

Hibernate is a high-performance Object/Relational persistence and query service. Hibernate is an ORM Framework.

## Why ORM?

When we work with an object-oriented systems, there's a mismatch between the object model and the relational database.
RDBMSs represent data in a tabular format whereas object-oriented languages, such as Java or C# represent it as an 
interconnected graph of objects. 

## What are some advantages of Hibernate?

-Hibernate takes care of mapping Java classes to database tables using XML files and without writing any line of code.

-Provides simple APIs for storing and retrieving Java objects directly to and from the database.

-If there is change in Database or in any table then the only need to change XML file properties.

-Abstract away the unfamiliar SQL types and provide us to work around familiar Java Objects.

-Hibernate does not require an application server to operate.

-Manipulates Complex associations of objects of your database.

-Minimize database access with smart fetching strategies.

-Provides Simple querying of data.
